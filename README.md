This repository demonstrates a common misconception about TypeScript's type safety. While TypeScript helps prevent many errors during development by performing static analysis, it cannot prevent all runtime errors.  This example shows a scenario where type safety is not sufficient to guarantee the absence of runtime errors.  The solution shows how to add more comprehensive error handling to address the issue.
